I am a graduate student of Fall 2019 at Northwest Missouri State University pursuing Masters in Applied Computer Science.

I am from India. I did my under graduation in Computer Science and Engineering. I do not have any prior experience but  with my interest I started learning basic tools for developing web pages like  HTML, CSS and gained a little knowledge on java script.

In this course I would like to learn a lot about new technologies used to develop web applications. The areas which i am looking forward to work are as follows:

1. web developing

2. Data Base Administration

3. Data Mining
